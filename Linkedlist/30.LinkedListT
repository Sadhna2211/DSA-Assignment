 Linked Lists:

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in a sequence. Each node contains two parts:
1.Data: The actual value or data the node holds.
2.Next (or reference): A pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node points to the next node, and the list is typically accessed by traversing these pointers.

Applications of Linked Lists in Algorithm Design:
                             
Linked lists are an essential data structure in algorithm design due to their flexibility, dynamic nature, and efficiency in specific operations. Here are some of the key applications:
1.Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Linked lists are often used to implement dynamic memory allocation. When memory needs to be allocated dynamically, a linked list can be used to keep track of free memory blocks, allowing for efficient memory management (e.g., in memory management systems).

2.Implementing Stacks and Queues:
Linked lists are commonly used to implement stack and queue data structures. In a stack, elements are added and removed in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner. In a queue, elements are added and removed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.

3.Undo Mechanism in Applications:
Many applications, such as text editors or drawing programs, maintain an undo stack using a linked list. Each node in the list represents a state, and the program can move back to the previous state by simply following the pointers.

4.Circular Buffers:
A circular buffer can be efficiently implemented using a circular linked list. It allows for continuous reading and writing in a fixed-size buffer without the need to shift elements, which can be useful in applications such as streaming data or producer-consumer problems.
