 Sliding Window Technique 
The sliding window technique is an efficient way to solve problems that involve finding subsets of a data structure (such as an array or string) that satisfy certain conditions. It is particularly useful for problems that require examining a contiguous subarray (or substring) and making decisions based on the elements within that subarray.

                        How It Works
1.The sliding window works by maintaining a "window" — a range of elements — within the array or string. This window "slides" through the array, gradually expanding or contracting depending on the conditions of the problem.

2.Fixed-size window: The size of the window is constant, and you slide it across the data structure.

3.Dynamic-size window: The size of the window can change dynamically based on certain conditions.


                       Use Cases in String Problems

1.Substrings of a Given Length or Property
Example: Find the longest substring with no repeating characters, or with exactly k distinct characters.

2.Substring or Subarray Sum/Conditions
Example: Find the longest subarray with a sum less than a given number or with exactly k even numbers.  

3.Anagrams and Permutations
Example: Check if a string contains any permutation of another string (by comparing character counts in a sliding window).
